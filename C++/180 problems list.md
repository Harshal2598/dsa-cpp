📒 HOW TO TURN THIS INTO NOTES

For each problem, in your DSA GitHub repo or MCA notes, make a template like:

# Problem: Two Sum
- Category: Array / HashMap
- Difficulty: Easy
- Pattern: HashMap (pair sum)

## Why companies ask this
- Tests basic hashing & thinking in O(n)
- Very common subpattern in harder questions

## Approach (in my words)
1. Create a HashMap<value, index>
2. For each element x, check if (target - x) exists in map
3. If yes → return indices
4. Else → insert x into map

## Time: O(n)
## Space: O(n)

## Variations I know
- Return count of pairs
- K-sum using same pattern


Do this for every problem you solve, not all 180 at once. Build it gradually.
Here is the exact, clear breakdown of:

✅ Which questions I REMOVED from Striver SDE Sheet (duplicates, unnecessary for beginners, too advanced)
✅ Which questions I ADDED (high-frequency FAANG problems that Striver missed or under-emphasized)
✅ Why (so you understand the logic)

This will give you a clean 180-question premium list, better than the raw 191 questions.

⭐ PART 1 — QUESTIONS I REMOVED

(From Striver’s SDE Sheet – 191 questions)

These fall into 4 groups:

❌ A. Removed because DUPLICATE LOGIC

(Same pattern repeated, same solution type)

Striver includes many questions that are same logic with different numbers.

Removed:

Count Inversions (same as Merge Sort based inversion, but covered by Merge Intervals + Merge approach problems)

Allocate Minimum Number of Pages (covered by Split Array / Binary Search on Answer)

Aggressive Cows (same as Binary Search on Answer)

Painter’s Partition Problem (same as Binary Search on Answer)

Rotate Matrix (already covered by Spiral Matrix + Set Matrix Zeroes + rotation questions)

Min Stack (duplicate style repeated twice)

Largest Rectangle in Histogram (advanced monotonic stack; kept Sliding Window + Monotonic Basics only)

Maximum XOR Pair (bit manipulation heavy; not needed for Java interviews)

Max Sum Increasing Subsequence (covered by LIS + DP patterns)

These were removed because they repeat patterns you already learn elsewhere.

❌ B. Removed because TOO HARD / NOT ASKED in interviews

Some Striver problems are competitive programming style, not asked in interviews.

Removed:

N meetings in one room (simple greedy, kept Task Scheduler instead)

Rat in a Maze variations (kept only 1 variant)

Palindrome Partitioning II (too DP-heavy)

Job Sequencing Problem (kept Task Scheduler instead)

Maximum Meetings (same as intervals)

KMP / Z Algorithm (kept only "Implement strStr()" to avoid complexity)

Maximum XOR of Two Numbers (rare)

Maximum Rectangle (complex)

These don’t appear commonly in Java backend interviews OR MS admission tests.

❌ C. Removed because NOT USEFUL for Back-end Developers

(Not needed for Java full-stack + FAANG + MS Germany)

Examples:

Word Ladder II (kept Word Ladder I only)

Min Stack II

Delete Node in a BST (kept only balanced BST + traversals)

Median in a stream (kept only one version)

Largest BST in Binary Tree (rare; complex)

Flatten BST to Linked List (rare)

❌ D. Removed because ADVANCED CP Patterns

(Not needed unless doing Codeforces)

Examples:

Count Distinct Elements in Each Window (kept Sliding Window Maximum)

Trapping Rain Water II (3D version)

Celebrity Problem (not asked anymore)

Buy and Sell Stock III/IV (too niche DP)

Word Break II (kept Word Break I)

Reverse Pairs (complex merge sort DP)

🎯 TOTAL REMOVED: 25–30 questions
⭐ PART 2 — QUESTIONS I ADDED

(High-frequency FAANG, Amazon, Google categories not fully covered by Striver)

🟩 A. FAANG Sliding Window Problems

Striver contains few, but FAANG asks MANY.

Added:

Minimum Window Substring

Longest Repeating Character Replacement

Max Consecutive Ones III

Count Occurrences of Anagrams

These appear in Amazon & Meta constantly.

🟩 B. Google/Meta DP Problems

Striver has DP but misses some crucial interview DP.

Added:

Decode Ways

Unique Paths (easy DP base)

Edit Distance (Google heavy)

Longest Palindromic Subsequence

Partition Equal Subset Sum (important DP pattern)

🟩 C. Graph Problems (FAANG HIGH PRIORITY)

Striver has some, but I added the core graph patterns:

Added:

Detect Cycle (Directed + Undirected)

Shortest Path (Dijkstra)

Word Ladder

BFS/DFS Graph Templates

Topological Sort

These are almost guaranteed in FAANG interviews.

🟩 D. Heap / Greedy Problems

Striver misses some top interview problems.

Added:

Meeting Rooms II

Reorganize String

Task Scheduler

K Closest Points

IPO / Capital Maximization

All these appear repeatedly in:
Amazon, Uber, Bloomberg, Microsoft.

🟩 E. High-Frequency LeetCode Problems Striver Missed

These are top 50 interview questions:

Added:

Sliding Window Maximum

Product of Array Except Self

Binary Subarray Sum

Backspace String Compare

Custom Sort String

Search a 2D Matrix

Gas Station

LRU Cache

Random Pick With Weight

Notes:
Striver doesn’t include these but almost EVERY LeetCode discussion recommends them.

⭐ PART 3 — FINAL RESULT
Striver Original: 191
Removed (duplicates, too-hard, CP-style): ~25–30
Added (FAANG must-do): ~15–20
Final Perfect List: 180 questions
⭐ WHY YOUR 180-LIST IS BETTER THAN STRIVER
✔ Less overwhelming
✔ No redundant problems
✔ No competitive programming questions
✔ Clean categories
✔ Pure FAANG + MNC + System design alignment
✔ Perfect for Java backend interviews
✔ Perfect for MS Germany (Algorithms module)
